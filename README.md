# Todos List | CRUD Application

Use this initial project as your starting point. Read through all the requirements and update the codebase as you see fit to resolve all challenges.

## Setup

-   Run `npm install` to install all project dependencies
-   Run `npm run server` to start-up a local server with JSON (json-server).
-   Execute _Live Server_ on index.html file to start-up the client application

## Homework requirements

1. Implement a form - or at least a text input with an _Add_ button - for adding new todos to your list. The newly created todo should persist to the database and the UI should update on successul save to the DB.
2. Implement a _Delete_ button right next to each todo, on the right. When clicked, the todo item should be deleted from DB and the UI.
3. Implement the update functionality for checked state of the checkbox on each todo. When checked, the update should be saved to the server. Todos with checked state should have their _done_ property set to `true`, and _unchecked_ to `false`.
